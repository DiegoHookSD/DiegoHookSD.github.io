              with a strong focus on cybersecurity and AI ethics. I'm also a U.S. Navy veteran,
              where I served as a cryptologic technician specializing in signals intelligence.
              My time in the military taught me the value of precision, integrity, and teamworkâ€”skills
              that I bring into every project I take on. I currently hold an active TS/SCI clearance
              with CI Polygraph and a PKI certification. I'm very excited to be interning this summer at
              <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman Mission Systems</a>

            <p>
              As a cryptolgist, I'm particularly interested in ethical hacking, data protection,
              and systems automation. I enjoy working on challenges that combine real-world impact
              with thoughtful designâ€”especially where security and usability intersect. I've gained
              experience working with Linux, virtual machines, and contained environments, and
              I'm continuing to grow my skills in Git and secure development practices.

              Outside of school, you'll find me practicing martial arts, traveling, or experimenting
              with new recipes in the kitchen. I recently explored Japan and fell in love with
              trying out kobini ready to eat foods!

            <h3>FlashCard Application</h3>

            <p>
              The <strong>FlashCard Application</strong> was our final class project to prove that we had mastered the concepts of
              Object Oriented design principles and Test Driven Development by giving us the choice to decide what Object Oriented design problem
              We wanted to create a project for. We decided to address a common study issue that eliminates the need to create and store physical
              flashcards and to track study progress whe using them. Quizlet has become a useful application for solving this issue so My partner mike
              and I were inspired by how they tackled the issue looking to emulate their design process
            </p>

            <p>
              We wanted to provide an interface in which users could either preload a csv file of a deck of pre-existing flashcards
              or to be able to create a new deck of customized flashcards. Then we want our users to be able to load their desired deck
              to initiate a study session based of on our study strategy algorithms we included. after a user interacts with their deck they
              are then displayed the results of their study session and are able to access a history of them to track their progress. This
              would address our goal of providing a sleek user experience while providing a quick and easy way to study.
            </p>

            <p>
              to design this project Mike and I decided to start from the most basic components of the code i.e. the flash cards and study strategies and
              then build up to creating the App & UI. we determined that since card creation was essential to solving our problem we needed to utilize the Factory
              method to give the project the ability to create different types of cards while making the code extendable to future card types like multiple choice.
              Secondly we decided to apply the strategy pattern to our Study Strategies to define a set of rules for creating algorithms that are all commonly responsible
              for iterating through a deck of cards like our sequential and random study strategies while having  a way for future developers to create extend their onw
              algorithms like a Knowledge level algorithm that prioritizes cards that the user commonly gets incorrect. for our deck files we decided to use a singleton desgin
              pattern to create a single/global access point for our filemanager to be referenced in our Flashcard Application in order to not interfere with the proper
              allocation/storage of files by having multiple instances of a filemanager. We used java to implement our TDD and classes due to our class experience shaping our familiarity
              with the language.
            </p>

            <p>
              For this Project i was personally responsible for all classes in the Study Strategy Design Pattern, the Study Session (for all instances of a
              study session and how it incorporates a deck and study strategy where used), Study Statistics (Report on results of study session for the User).
              And the first half of creating our User interface and the Readme. All pieces of these works required me to collaborate with Micheal in order to
              properly test/code/implement my portion to his components requirements and vice versa so we did a lot of zoom and in person pair coding on our own modules.
              Test Driven Development was so crucial in this project because we were able to confirm the behaviors of components that future more complicated code
              which would have been extremely difficult to debug and fix if we had created everything first and tested after.

            <h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>

            <p>
              The <strong>Elevator Simulator</strong> was an exercise that aimed to provide us
              practice on the fundamentals of Test Driven Development by emulating an elevator system.
              We designed a developed a plan to implement different types of elevators i.e.
              Standard, Freight, Penthouse, and Express which followed their own servicing rules.
              For example, Express elevators only service the top half of the building and first floor, while freight
              elevators can only carry one passenger at a time. A scheduler assigns passenger calls to the appropriate
              elevator, and the simulation progresses in rounds with status updates.
            </p>

            <p>
              We implemented an inheritance hierarchy with AbstractElevator as the base class to encapsulate
              common functionality like movement and call processing, allowing concrete elevators to be customized to their service requirements .
              We applied the Strategy pattern through the Scheduler interface to make call assignment algorithms
              interchangeable, supporting both simple and complex approaches without
              modifying the elevator code.
            </p>

            <p>
              For this project, we started our process by writing our tests with the ideal functionality of the code in mind.
              Then for every test we wrote, we would configure methods in the code in order to pass those tests, which helped prevent
              massive rebuilding of code later down the line. I was primarily responsible for implementing the AbstractElevator class
              which served as the blueprint for our elevator classes. I also worked on the Call class which represented a passenger
              request with specific entry and exit floors. I implemented the ComplexScheduler to implement the Scheduler interface as an assignment
              algorithm that found the distance between each eligible elevator in order to bring the nearest elevator to the passenger.
              I also provided the implementations of the previously mentioned Freight and Express elevator classes.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project helped to strengthen my object oriented design software engineering skills through test-driven development and helped me practice our clean code practices
              and teamwork by modeling complex behaviors in software.

            <h3>Birthday Paradox Simulation & Testing</h3>

            <p>
              The <strong>Birthday Paradox</strong> is a surprising statistical concept: in a group of just 23 people, there's a greater than 50% chance that
              at least two people share the same birthday.  this project helped us display our knowledge in class concepts and allowed us to
              bring the paradox implementation through a hands-on coding experiment.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal of our project was to simulate this paradox by running multiple birthday-matching experiments across group sizes ranging from
              5 to 100 people. Our program runs a series of trials  and calculates the percentage of trials where a shared birthday occurred.
              It outputs the results in a clean table, allowing users to visually see how the probabilities change as group sizes increase.
            </p>

            <p>
              I worked closely with my partner <strong>Mike</strong> on this two-part project. In the first part, we developed the full simulation in Java using object-oriented design.
              In the second part, we added unit tests to make sure all parts of our code worked correctly and handled edge cases. Our project also required
              us to use GitHub collaboratively practicing branches, opened pull requests, and reviewed each other's code.
            </p>

              This project taught me a lot about writing clean code, working as a team, and testing our work to catch
              mistakes early. It made concepts like probability and collaboration feel much more real and showed me what it's like to work on a real-world software project.
